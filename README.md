## What is this?

ImOnAPlane is a fun app I started to work on on my flight to Schnitzelconf 2010. A few people had tweeted their flight numbers to find out if others were on the same flight - this app does the same: it lets you enter your flight number and date and will show you everyone else who is on that flight.

## Status/Development

This is probably not even in pre alpha yet. The good news though is that it's open source, so if you have anything to contribute (copy, design, programming) please fork this repo and send me a pull request.

Developers: I will only pull in changes with tests. See the `features/` and `spec/` directories for examples. For now I keep a list of feature ideas in [doc/features.md](http://github.com/langalex/imonaplane/blog/master/doc/feature.md).
